# Title
House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

# Description
A US-based housing company, which uses data analytics to purchase houses below their actual values and flip them at higher prices, has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

The goal of the analytics project is to build a regression model using regularization to:
- predict the actual values of prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not,
- identify the variables that are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- determine the extent to which those variables influence the price of the house.

The model will be used to understand how house prices vary with associated variables and improve the strategy of the firm.

# Approach to Analysis
Analysis is performed as per the following steps:
- Data Understanding & Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preparation
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation
- Model Interpretation

# Results
The final Lasso regression model has 29 explanatory variables and the following performance metrics:
- Training R^2 score = 0.836460
- Test R^2 score = 0.856155
- Training MSE = 0.002719
- Test MSE = 0.002509

The model correctly identifies the various factors affecting house prices.
